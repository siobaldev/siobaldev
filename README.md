✨ Hey there!

I'm Minard Siobal, a web developer creating artistic yet functional digital experiences with a focus on thoughtful design and intuitive interactions. I enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces that are both visually appealing and engaging.

I build web applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL(Supabase) — bringing interfaces to life with motion and subtle animations using libraries like Motion (formerly Framer Motion).
